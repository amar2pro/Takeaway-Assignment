**You have a list of items displaying post data, and you want to display them sequentially. You also want to allow a keyboard user to navigate the list using their keyboard, and when they press the Escape key, navigate to the parent element. This is important for users who rely on navigation through keyboard shortcuts and their screen readers.**

The interface of this small website features a colorful and accessible grid of ten unique car cards, each with a catchy tagline and image. These cards are organized using a responsive layout built with Tailwind CSS to enhance both visual appeal and usability. The list is structured as a `listbox` containing `option` elements, making it easily identifiable for assistive technologies like screen readers. The first car in the list receives focus when the page loads, helping users begin navigation instantly.

Keyboard users can move through the list using the **ArrowDown**, **ArrowUp**, **ArrowLeft**, and **ArrowRight** keys to highlight different car cards. A visible red focus ring (styled using Tailwindâ€™s utility classes like `ring-2 ring-red-500`) shows which card is currently selected. The **Tab** key moves focus into the list, and pressing the **Escape** key returns focus to the parent container, effectively allowing users to exit the list. This ensures a smooth and accessible browsing experience for all users.
